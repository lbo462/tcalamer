"""
This file doesn't define any action but handle their registering

In order to register an action, create an instance of ActionRegistry and call it as a decorator as such:
>>> ar = ActionRegistry()
>>> @ar(id_=1)
>>> def foo():
>>>   ...

The registered functions are accessible though the created instance as such:
>>> print(ar.actions)

To call a registered method, use
>>> ar.call_action(1, ...)
